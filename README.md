Rebolito is a programming language drawing most of it's inspiration from Rebol. It's implemented as an interpreter on top of Ruby.

###Why?###
For now it's just an experiment, a programming exercise, and ambisions are low. What I'm hoping for is to create a small language I myself will find usefull for minor scripting tasks - as I really love parts of the Rebol language.
